## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

Our vision is to create a revolutionary Python code visualization tool that transforms the way developers understand and interact with codebases. Here's our roadmap to achieving this vision:

### Phase 1: Enhanced Visualization Framework
- [ ] Implement a node-based visualization system inspired by Blender's node editor
- [ ] Develop a custom rendering engine for smooth, high-performance graph display
- [ ] Create a zoomable interface with Google Maps-like functionality for exploring code at different levels of detail

### Phase 2: Advanced Code Analysis
- [ ] Enhance AST parsing to extract more detailed information about code structure and relationships
- [ ] Implement data flow analysis to track variable usage and value propagation across the codebase
- [ ] Develop algorithms to identify and visualize code patterns and potential optimizations

### Phase 3: Interactive Node-Based Code Representation
- [ ] Design and implement visual representations for different code elements (functions, classes, variables) as interactive nodes
- [ ] Create a system for visually connecting nodes to represent data flow and function calls
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop functionality for rearranging and connecting nodes

### Phase 4: Multi-Level Detail Visualization
- [ ] Develop a system for displaying different levels of code detail based on zoom level
- [ ] Implement smooth transitions between detail levels during zooming
- [ ] Create summarization algorithms to generate high-level overviews of code sections

### Phase 5: Real-Time Code Editing and Visualization Updates
- [ ] Integrate a code editor that allows real-time modifications to the visualized code
- [ ] Implement instant visual updates to reflect code changes in the node-based representation
- [ ] Develop a system for visualizing the impact of code changes on the overall structure and data flow

### Phase 6: Collaborative Features
- [ ] Implement multi-user support for simultaneous visualization and editing
- [ ] Develop a system for leaving comments and annotations on specific nodes or connections
- [ ] Create visualization overlays for showing code ownership, recent changes, and areas of high activity

### Phase 7: AI-Assisted Code Understanding
- [ ] Integrate machine learning models to suggest code improvements and optimizations
- [ ] Develop AI-powered code summarization for quick understanding of complex sections
- [ ] Implement predictive visualization of potential code paths and data flow based on AI analysis

### Phase 8: Version Control Integration
- [ ] Develop visualizations for code evolution over time, integrated with Git or other version control systems
- [ ] Implement visual diff tools for comparing different versions of the code structure
- [ ] Create animations to show how code structure and data flow have changed between commits

### Phase 9: Performance Optimization for Large Codebases
- [ ] Implement progressive loading and rendering for handling extremely large projects
- [ ] Develop intelligent caching mechanisms for faster navigation of previously viewed code sections
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for sustained performance with complex visualizations

### Phase 10: Extensibility and Ecosystem
- [ ] Design and implement a plugin system for custom visualizations and analyses
- [ ] Develop API for integration with IDEs and other development tools
- [ ] Create a marketplace for sharing custom visualization templates and analysis modules

This roadmap represents our commitment to revolutionizing code understanding and manipulation. By following this path, we aim to create a tool that not only visualizes code but transforms the entire software development workflow, making it more intuitive, efficient, and collaborative.

We invite the community to join us on this exciting journey. Your feedback, contributions, and ideas will be crucial in shaping the future of code visualization and comprehension.
